### Topic : Database Users and Database Administrator

---


Hey! Have you ever heard about Data-base Administrator, if not this page is for you as I will share knowledge about Data-base Administrator roles, functions and different types of database user that I have learned during flipped class.

Firstly, let us understand what Data-base Administrator is before going into depth.
From my understanding, Data-base Administrator is a role in Computer System Administrator where different people works together in creating and maintaining secure database. With this simple understanding let us Go further where I will explain the roles and responsibilities of Data-base Adminstrator and their function.

### Data-base Administrator Roles and Responsibilities
There are many roles and responsibilities of DBA but I will mention out only five important points:

1. Creating and manintaining data dictionaries and data flow diagrams.
2. Ensures databases are safe and it is protected from unauthorized access.
3. prevent data-loss during disasters and attacks.
4. identifying data-base issues and resolving them. 
5. Having a relation with data-base vendors and service providers.


To talk about the function of Data-base Administrator, there are two major functions. They are:

###  Data-base Design :
It improves data-base functionality and make data-base run fast by planning how data is stored and searched. Not only that it helps in back-up and recovery of data during disaster.

###  Database Security :
It ensure proper access control, detects suspicious activity, stays updated and most importantly, important information is encrypted when it is stored or transferred.
We have come to an end of functions and roles of DBA. 

Lastly, I am going to explain about different types of data-base user. There are eight types of data-base users in Data Base Management System including data-base administrator which I have explained briefly above.

### The other new Data-base user are:

#### Naive / Parametric End Users:
They are the user which lack knowledge about Data-base Management System (DBMS) but frequently use the data-base application daily and perform their given task. for example, Clerks in any bank.

#### System Analyst:
They are the user who analyzes naive users and check whether all the naive user requirements are fullfilled or satisfied.

#### Sophisticated Users: 
They are the user who have knowledge about DBMS and can develop their own data-base applications according to their requirement. They interact the data-base by writing SQL quires (which is a skills Required for data-base) directly through the query processor. For example, engineers, scientists

#### Data-base Designers: 
They are the user who understand the requirements of different user groups and design the structure of database which satisfies the need of all the user group. Not only that, they controls what data must be stored and how data items are related.

#### Application Programmers:
They are the user or computer professionals who writes the code for the application programs. They design, debug, test and manintain a set of programs for Naive users to interact with data-base. For example, Software Engineers.

#### Casual Users/Temporary Users:
They are the user who access the data-base occasionally with new information. For example, Manager.

#### Specialized users:
They are user who are familiar with database and write specialized database application.

The above studies is accomplished due to attaining Flipped class where four groups, each group containing six or seven students are divided into two topics mentioned above. In respective groups formed, we discuss around twenty minutes where each member shares knowledge about respective topic given. That way we learn more and after twenty minutes another group is formed for another twenty minutes to share our knowledge with other group who are in different topic in exchange of their knowlege. Lastly, after twenty minutes, question and answer sesssion between lectural and students are done for fifteen minutes.

My suggestion on improvement of flipped class is that if miss could send notes along with vedios, It would help much more to understand that particular topic.
