### What I learned during flipped class!
---
Hello there, I'm Tenzin Namgay, and this is my second journal entry about what I learned during the flipped class. I hope you are excited to learn about Entity-Relationship diagram, which is the topic for this journal. Without any further, let's get started.

During flipped class, we learned that ER diagram consist of major components namely Entity and Attributes. Each of this two has it's own representation, where Entity is denoted as rectangle and Attributes as ellipse.
The relationship between these two components is that Attributes describe Entities, which can contain any number of attributes connected to them, and each entity has one primary key attribute.

Then, we learned about the types of Attributes.They are many types of Attributes, they are simple and composite attributes. Single attributes are those attributes which cannot be divided into subparts, whereas composite attributes can divide into subparts. Next we have single-valued and multi-valued attributes. Single-Valued attributes are those who have single value for each entity, while multi-valued are those who have more than one value or set of values for each entity.
Lastly, we have derived and store attributes. Derived attribute, by the name of the attribute, we can tell that attribute can be derived from other related attribute and store attributes is the attribute from which other atttribute is derived and doesn't require further update.

In the end, We also learned about the relationship in ER diagram, where relationship is denoted by diamond-shaped box and are connected to those entities which are participating in relationship. Additionally, we also learned about Cardinality, which means figuring out how many item from one entity are connected to items in another entity.For example, we have one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many relationships. 

In a nutshell, during the flipped class, we learned about the components of the ER diagram as explained above, followed by several important types of attributes, and lastly, relationships in ER diagrams with cardinality.

### What I did in flipped class!

During flippped class, six groups were divided, with four students in each group. Different topics were distributed to the groups, including online health book, airline ticketing, mobile banking appplication, student informationmanagement system, bus booking and voter registration. Each group received one topic, and We were given sixty-minutes group discussion to create Entity-Relationship diagram for our assigned topic. We had to draw it on chart-paper provided by our lecturer. Then, after sixty-minutes of group discussion, one member from each group had to present their work and another member from the same group had to explain their ER diagram for that particular topic to the whole class for ten-minutes each. After ten-minutes, same as earlier group, another ten-minutes group presentation is given and this keeps on going until group six finishes, resulting in a total presentation time of one hour. 

### Feed-back

The ER diagram drawn on chart paper was not visually appealing in any of the groups. If we had been given one-day time and asked to create it on a laptop and present it using a projector, it would have benefited both the presenters and the audience. This could have resulted in a better understanding of the diagram.
