Hey there, this is my third journal entry on Unit III, which is Convolutional Neural Networks. I hope those who are viewing my journal are excited to learn, as I am going to give a brief explanation on this particular unit. Without any further delay, let's get started.

### Convolutional Neural Network
---

 In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual data like images or videos. Now when we think of a neural network we think about matrix multiplications, the key idea behind CNNs is to use small filters or kernels that scan across the input image, extracting features at different locations.I will explain in brief about filters when i reach at kernal which I will explain later.

 CNNs typically consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers (which apply the filters), pooling layers (which downsample the feature maps), and fully-connected layers (similar to traditional neural networks). This architecture enables CNNs to capture both low-level and high-level features, making them highly effective for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
