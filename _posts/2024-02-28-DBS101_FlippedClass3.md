### What I learned during flipped class!
---

Hello there! this my third journal entry about what I learned during flipped class.I will share my understanding about SQL-Set-Operation and SQL null-values.I hope you all are motivated to learn, without any further, let's get started.

During flipped-class, SQL-set-Operation were discussed and learned.Before going into breif,there are rules required for this operation to work;
1. Number and order of columns must be same.
2. Data-types must be compatible.

If this two rules are not fullfilled, the operation won't work.
Now let's talk about sets of SQL-Operations,they are Union, Union-All, Intersect, Minus.I will explain each one them based on how I understand during flipped class.

UNION : is the combination of SQL SELECT Queries and removes duplicate rows form result-set.
UNION-ALL: Combination of SQL SELECT Queries without removing duplicate.
INTERSECT: Combination of two SELECT staments and returns common rows from both.
MINUS : Combination of two SELECT staments and display rows in first query and absent in second.

Now, let me explain null values in SQL, Null-value means no value in simple terms. To test null values, IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators is used.In SQL, null-values is used to represent missing, unknown-data or data that doesn't exist.To talk about principles of null values, there are many but I will share three of them. Firstly when the value is unknown, null-value is called. Secondly, null-values is different from zero value and spaces. Lastly, null-values can be used in any column as it is not tied to specific data-type.

### What I did in flipped class!

The above understanding is accomplished due to attaining Flipped class where thirty-minutes time were given to go through the notes that were provided. Then  four groups, each group containing six or seven students are divided into two topics namely SQL-Set Operators and SQL null-values. In respective groups formed, we discuss around thirty minutes where each member shares knowledge about how they understand their respective topic given and after thirty-minutes another group is formed for another thirty-minutes to share the understanding of particular topic  with other group who are in different topic in exchange of their knowlege. That way the flipped class is done for the day.

### Feed-back

The quiz should be done after discussing all the necessary topics in order to know how much we have understood from learning it.
