### What I learned during flipped class!

---

Hello there, I'm Tenzin Namgay, and this is my  journal entry about what I learned during the flipped class. I hope you are excited to learn about Deep learning fundamentals, which is the topic for this journal. Without any further, let's get started.

Firstly, let us understand what Artifical Intelligence is before going into depth.
AI is started by Arthur Samuel at ninteenth century, it is a machine and has ability to mimic human behaviour.
In this modern world, AI learns, improves and handle complex problem like converting text-to-speech, Image detection using python and many more.

With this understanding, let us differentiate between deep-learning and machine-learning.
Deep-learning uses complex mathametical algorithm in large dataset to detect patterns, whereas AI uses nerual network that learns dataset(just like human brain but does the work by machine).AI handles more data than machine-learning, hence it handles complex problem as mentioned above. In simple terms, from my understanding, AI aims in mimicking human behaviour, whereas ML learns data and improve performance by using algorithms.
